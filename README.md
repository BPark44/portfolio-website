Welcome to my portfolio website!

This website was my first time using Sass(SCSS) and I loved it. I really enojoyed the ease of nesting inside of the stylesheet. Allowed me to really streamline the styling of the website.

I also enjoyed adding the contact form and figuring out how to make the form send through to my e-mail account.

This website is also live, you can view it here;
